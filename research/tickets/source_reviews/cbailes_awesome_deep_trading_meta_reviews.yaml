notes:
  final_verdict: Research first
  review_scope: curation quality + meta-review subsection completeness + LPDD fit
  reusable_items:
    - Curated meta-survey entry point for evidence-led literature triage
    - Paper-level taxonomy useful for research backlog decomposition
  conflicts:
    - Curated list is stale and not itself a validated methodology implementation
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 70
      recommendation: Use as literature index only; evaluate each cited paper independently before roadmap impact
