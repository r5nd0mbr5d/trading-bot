notes:
  final_verdict: Research first
  review_scope: README + repository architecture + governance fit
  reusable_items:
    - Robust websocket client patterns with reconnect and async support
    - Demo/testnet toggling approach for safe pre-production workflow
  conflicts:
    - Venue-specific client would increase coupling versus current multi-broker abstraction
    - Direct trade examples need enforced RiskManager mediation
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 64
      recommendation: Reuse websocket and testnet safety patterns in broker adapters without replacing broker abstractions
