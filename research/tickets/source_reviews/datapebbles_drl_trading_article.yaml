notes:
  final_verdict: Research first
  review_scope: full article content + code snippets + limitations section
  reusable_items:
    - Explicit train/validation split pattern and simple environment scaffolding
    - Clear limitations section (feature breadth, single-asset overfitting risk, stability caveats)
  conflicts:
    - Demonstration setup is educational and not production-grade for execution governance
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 70
      recommendation: Reuse RL experiment framing and caveat language in research specs only
