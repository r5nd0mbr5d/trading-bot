notes:
  final_verdict: Research first
  review_scope: README + repository architecture + governance fit
  reusable_items:
    - Walk-forward validation tutorial framing and overfitting warning structure
    - Commission-aware RL evaluation framing for reward scheme design
  conflicts:
    - RL-oriented direct execution abstractions are not aligned by default with strict risk-gate routing
    - Crypto-centric default examples need adaptation for UK-first equities operating mode
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 70
      recommendation: Extract a research note on commission-aware reward shaping and walk-forward RL validation as optional ML extension
