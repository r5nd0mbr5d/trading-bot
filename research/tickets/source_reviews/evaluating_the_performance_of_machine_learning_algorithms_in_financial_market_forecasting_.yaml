  reusable_items:
    - Comparative evaluation framing for ML algorithms and forecasting horizons
    - Useful checklist-style discussion of validation pitfalls and performance metric interpretation
  conflicts:
    - Survey-level conclusions are not executable architecture and must be translated into LPDD-safe experiments
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 70
      recommendation: Reuse benchmarking framework language in research specs; do not treat as implementation authority
