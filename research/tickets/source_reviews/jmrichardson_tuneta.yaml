notes:
  final_verdict: Research first
  review_scope: README + repository architecture + governance fit
  reusable_items:
    - Feature pruning heuristics for inter-correlation control in ML feature engineering
    - Distance-correlation based indicator selection for research notebooks
  conflicts:
    - Maintenance appears inactive, reducing confidence for direct dependency
    - Optimization focus can induce data-mining risk without strict walk-forward discipline
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 70
      recommendation: Prototype offline feature-selection utility only, gated behind research layer
