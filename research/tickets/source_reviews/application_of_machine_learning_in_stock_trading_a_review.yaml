  reusable_items:
    - High-level taxonomy for ML model families and evaluation factors in stock forecasting literature
  conflicts:
    - Review-era evidence predates current market microstructure and modern validation expectations
    - Limited direct mapping to LPDD execution/risk invariants without additional implementation gating
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 70
      recommendation: Use as background taxonomy source only; require modern out-of-sample and cost-aware validation before adoption
