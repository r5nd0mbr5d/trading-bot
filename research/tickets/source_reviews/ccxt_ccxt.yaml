notes:
  final_verdict: Adopt now
  review_scope: README + repository architecture + governance fit
  reusable_items:
    - Unified multi-exchange API abstraction patterns and exchange capability normalization
    - Built-in rate-limiter configuration patterns for exchange-specific constraints
  conflicts:
    - Library-level API broker assumptions require explicit fee and rebate neutrality checks per venue
    - Direct order placement examples must still route through local RiskManager gate
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 63
      recommendation: Add optional adapter-layer compatibility tests against CCXT symbol/precision schemas without replacing primary broker integrations
