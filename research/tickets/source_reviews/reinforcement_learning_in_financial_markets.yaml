  reusable_items:
    - RL problem framing and environment-design considerations for financial tasks
    - Common RL evaluation caveats applicable to internal research protocols
  conflicts:
    - Survey emphasizes RL potential but does not provide LPDD-compliant production control patterns
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 70
      recommendation: Use for RL experiment scoping only; enforce strict risk gate and paper-mode validation before any runtime consideration
