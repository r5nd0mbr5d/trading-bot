notes:
  final_verdict: Research first
  review_scope: README + repository architecture + governance fit
  reusable_items:
    - Broker simulation features checklist (order types, slippage, commission schemes)
    - Multi-timeframe and analyzer concept references for backtest enhancements
  conflicts:
    - Maintenance cadence is low relative to active alternatives
    - Direct framework adoption would conflict with existing engine invariants and interfaces

      recommendation: Borrow simulation feature ideas only; keep BacktestEngine as system of record
