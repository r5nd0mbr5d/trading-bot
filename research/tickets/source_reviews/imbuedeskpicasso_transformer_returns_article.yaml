notes:
  final_verdict: Reject
  review_scope: article claims + exposed code fragments + disclosure quality
  reusable_items:
    - Reminder to demand explicit transaction-cost assumptions and out-of-sample protocol before claim acceptance
  conflicts:
    - Extraordinary return claims with weak independently verifiable protocol details
    - Commercial code-gating and promotional framing reduce auditability
  ticket_recommendations:
    - step: 70
      recommendation: Keep as negative-case evidence for claim-integrity cautions; no implementation adoption
